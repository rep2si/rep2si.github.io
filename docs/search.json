    "text": "I conducted fieldwork in rural North India from February to June 2024. As I had not predetermined a specific fieldsite, my initial task was to identify a location that aligned with the project’s criteria. Consequently, the first few days were dedicated to finding a suitable site. I benefited from discussions with local NGOs working in the region and leveraged my prior contacts. After visiting several villages, I was able to select one for the study. This village comprised approximately 150 households, representing a mix of almost five different caste groups.\n\n\n\nA view of Komal’s fieldsite\n\n\nWhile I am proficient in Hindi, the local dialect, Braj, posed some challenges to my comprehension. Therefore, I needed research assistants fluent in the dialect, who could also support the structured data collection process. I recruited two assistants, Mr. Aditya Sengar and Mr. Arvind Kumar, both of whom had prior experience conducting surveys with local NGOs and showed ethical and sensitive engagement with research participants.\n\n\n\nThe research team in India\n\n\nThe structured data collection involved gathering information on kinship, demographics, and wealth. Given the sensitive nature of wealth data, I began by collecting kinship data and gradually incorporated demographic and wealth data into the process. To ensure I engaged with every household, I personally collected the kinship data for each household, while delegating the demographic and wealth data collection to my research assistants. This approach not only allowed me to gain visibility within the village but also helped establish rapport with the community.\nIn addition to the structured data collection, the qualitative data collection involved conducting approximately 13 interviews on topics such as reputation, gossip, debt and credit relations, and agricultural land market in the village. Through general participant observation, I also gained valuable insights into the village’s caste dynamics and the mechanisms through which caste-based exploitation occurs."

    "text": "My work began with locating a community that meets the requirements of the rep²si project. This meant finding a village of the appropriate size, with a mix of different castes and ethnic groups. I benefited tremendously from the help of Mr Ratna Bishwakarma at this stage of the project, who took me to visit a number of villages in his home district of Sindupalchowk.\n\n\n\nA view of Ivan’s fieldsite\n\n\nOnce an appropriate village was located, I began collecting kinship, demographic, GIS and wealth data for all its residents. Acquiring this information for each of the 173 households that make up the community was a long process; this is by far what I spent most of my time on. In parallel, I also conducted some semi-structured interviews and did some general participant observation in the community.\n\n\n\nThe village in which I work is fairly spread out. Clusters of houses are separated by dirt roads and small footpaths such as these.\n\n\nI was lucky to work with some very talented research assistants. Ms Abhilasha Sharma helped me throughout the fieldwork, and the two of us were later joined by three students in anthropology from Tribhuvan University: Anurag Lamsal, Samana Rai and Amar Hang. Working with multiple research assistants was a new and deeply enjoyable experience for me. I found it particularly stimulating to collaborate with young (and highly talented) students from my own discipline, and getting to hear their own perspectives on social science and research in Nepal was enriching.\n\n\n\nThe research team for Nepal"

    "text": "Project Abstract\n\n\n\nThis project assembles a diverse team including ethnographers, a network modeller, and an experimentalist to undertake a cross-cultural study of the micro-dynamics of social inequality. We will examine how people’s identities and social position influence how they are perceived by others, and so how they consequently choose to act in the world. Working in three communities in South Asia and yet more across the globe, we will use a novel combination of ethnographic, experimental, and network methods to see if, and if so how, these dynamics result in a “reputational poverty trap” that reinforces social and economic inequality.\n\n\nThis project grows out of Dr. Power’s earlier fieldwork and research in Tamil Nadu. In an earlier paper “When Does Reputation Lie: Dynamic Feedbacks Between Costly Signals, Social Capital and Social Prominence” written with colleagues Marion Dumas and Jessie Barker, she presented the idea of a “reputational poverty trap,” drawing on some ethnographic illustration and then formalising this with analytic and agent-based models.\nThe aim of Rep²SI is to explore these dynamics further, taking a comparative and mixed-methods approach. We will focus primarily on South Asia, but also look to other communities around the world to see how these dynamics vary in different sociocultural settings. We plan to collaborate with members of the ENDOW project, a US NSF-funded project that has a large team of anthropologists gathering demographic, economic, and social network data in communities around the world.\nYou can read the original project proposal below:"
