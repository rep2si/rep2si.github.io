Rep²SI (**Reputation** and the **Reproduction** of **Social Inequality**) is a project based in the [Deparment of Methodology](https://www.lse.ac.uk/Methodology) at the [London School of Economics](https://www.lse.ac.uk/), funded by a Research Leadership Award from the [Leverhulme Trust](leverhulme.ac.uk/). 

This is a collaborative project, with an interdisciplinary [team](team.qmd) led by Dr. [Eleanor Power](https://eapower.github.io/). We will shortly be advertising for three postdoctoral research officer posts -- keep an eye out!
