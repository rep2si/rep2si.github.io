Rep²SI (**Reputation** and the **Reproduction** of **Social Inequality**) is a project based in the [Deparment of Methodology](https://www.lse.ac.uk/Methodology) at the [London School of Economics](https://www.lse.ac.uk/), funded by a Research Leadership Award from the [Leverhulme Trust](leverhulme.ac.uk/). 

This is a collaborative project, with an interdisciplinary [team](team.qmd) led by Dr. [Eleanor Power](https://eapower.github.io/). Applications for three of the postdoctoral research officer posts are now live, with a submission deadline of 21 April 2023. We would expect to hold virtual interviews in early May and would hope to have people starting in post in autumn 2023.
