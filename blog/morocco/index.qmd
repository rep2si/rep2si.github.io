# Morocco Fieldwork

In March 2024, Poorvi joined collaborators [Sarah Alami and Ed Seabright](https://codemlab.github.io/) in further fieldwork in the Atlas Mountains in Morocco. The two are based at the [School of Collective Intelligence](https://sci.um6p.ma/) at the [University Mohammed VI Polytechnic](https://www.um6p.ma/en).
